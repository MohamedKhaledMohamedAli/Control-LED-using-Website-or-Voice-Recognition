# Control-LED-using-Website-or-Voice-Recognition

Implemented a system for controlling an LED using a web interface or voice recognition. Users can access the website to toggle the LED on or off, or alternatively, utilize a voice recognition program developed in Python to change the LED state through voice commands. The LED is managed by C++ code that interfaces with a Raspberry Pi, which controls the LED pins. The C++ program retrieves the desired LED state from the website, facilitating seamless interaction between the user inputs and hardware control.
